An example of how to use tween effects to animate a water fountain

I put it together in response to this request on [r/godot](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/i37eoc/2d_water_animation_in_godot_any_suggestions_on/).

The art is from the [Pipoya RPG Tileset](https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32x32).
